# SeleniumAutomationTesting

This repository contains twenty five automated system test cases for testing a simple website using python and **Selenium testing framework**. The tests have been recorded and then exported to a python file using the **Selenium IDE**. The accompanying zip file includes the files for the test website. This has been a part of an assignment in a software quality course.
