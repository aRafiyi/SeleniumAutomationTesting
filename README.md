# SeleniumAutomationTesting

This repository contains twenty five automated system test cases for testing a simple website using python and **Selenium testing framework**. The tests have been recorded and then exported to a python file using the **Selenium IDE**. The accompanying files are:

- two MS Word documents including installation instructions for **Apache Web Server** and for recording test cases
- the zip file `TestingWebsite` including the files for the test website
- `SeleniumAutomationTesting.py` file including the recorded test cases.

This has been a part of an assignment in a software quality coure.
